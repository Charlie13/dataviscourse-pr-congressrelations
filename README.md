# PoliVis: Congressional Political Relationships

*By Curtis Miller and Jignesh Rawal*

## Code

We started from an HTML5 Boilerplate template. Most code for the website is in the **src** directory. Our own code is included in:

	* index.html
	* src/congress.js
	* src/main.js
	* src/mapVis.js
	* src/scatterVis.js
	* data/Senate114Metadata.json
	* data/SenateRecord114.json
	* css/main.css

The rest, save for map_test.html and scatterplot_test.html and the favicon, are provided by HTML5 Boilerplate.

## Process Book

See CS6630ProjectNotebook.pdf for the process book.

## Website

You can find the live website [here](http://ntguardian.github.io). This website also contains the YouTube video demonstration, which is also available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wa0vqh6O1Qw).

Usage of the visualizations and the site should be obvious. Just start hovering and clicking on things, and have fun!
